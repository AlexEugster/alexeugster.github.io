This hands-on workshop is free to all US State of the Map conference attendees and designed to help educators & students of all kinds to:

* Understand why OpenStreetMap is a great tool for teaching geography
* How to map using OpenStreetMap
* How to design and teach classroom modules around OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Details:
* Workshop date/time: Monday, June 8th, 9am-1pm.
* Workshop location: NYU Global Center for Academic & Spiritual Life, 238 Thompson St, 3rd Fl, NYC 10012

Workshop Objectives:

* Develop a mapping activity that can be replicated easily and scaled to accommodate a wide range of teachers
* Develop a mapping activity that students can undertake for community service

For or teachers/educators/librarians - devoted to methods for teachers wanting to incorporate OpenStreetMap into their classrooms

* OpenStreetMap: The Project
* Intro to editing OSM
* Conducting field work
* Tools to assess quality (Overpass Turbo) and assign credit
* Organizing and event: How-To
* focus on refining educational (pedacological) aspects of teaching mapping OpenStreetMap
  * Mapping guided historical trails (architectural walking tours)
  * Street-level Survey (e.g. DC GreatStreets)
  * MapGive/HOT  (e.g. meeting humanitarian needs)

Mapping has applicability across many fields and communities of interest, and can used to document, archive, plan and contribute to both local and international initiatives. During this workshop we will demonstrate a training program, which will incorporate hands-on mapping in the OSM environment. We would like to see other instructors replicate this mapping program for their particular discipline and curricular needs.
