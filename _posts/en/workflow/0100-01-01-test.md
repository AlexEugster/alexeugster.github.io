## The Assignment Workflow 
There is a lot of preparation behind a successful mapping assignment. 

Selection of a study area, determining if there is sufficient mapping work for your students in this area, assigning equitable tasks to those students, and deciding if there is to be a formal grading element to this exercise. 

Taking time to plan the assignment is crucial to a successful outcome. 

Developing a workflow for an OSM class assignment can be broken down into 5 essential steps. 

These are:

1. Choosing where to map
2. Assigning work to participants
3. Conducting Training
4. Mapping in the field with Field Papers
5. Grading & Quality Control

The first three step should be common to all assignment workflows, whether the mapping exercise takes place in a traditional classroom setting, or not. Step 4 depends on whether there is a local field mapping component possible/expected, and step 5 suggests approaches for grading in a traditional classroom setting. 

Following these steps should prepare you well in developing, assigning and training your class.
