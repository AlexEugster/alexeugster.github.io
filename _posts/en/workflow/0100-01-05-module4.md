#STEP 4: Mapping in the field with Field Papers
##What are Field Papers?

Field Papers is a web-based tool for easily creating a printable map atlas for anywhere in the world that you can print and add notes to.
It is one way to edit OpenStreetMap in a low-tech and easy way to:

1. print the map 
2. go out in the field and sketch what you see
3. then come back, and either take a photo/make a scan of your map and upload it or just look at your sheet of paper and use it as aid to your brain's memory
4. add your surveyed information to the OpenStreetMap database
