#STEP 2: Assigning work to participants
##Assigning the work
Assigning the work to your group can be done in a number of ways. For instance, work can be assigned as a quota of infrastructure to trace (i.e. 50 buildings, and/or 50 roads per student), or, one can assign designated cells to each student, or, a combination of both of these methods.  
The creation of cells is done through OSM Tasking Manager (OSM TM) and is explained in the next section. 

##TeachOSM TaskingManager
In addition to the OpenStreetMap website, we make use of a tasking tool called TaskingManager. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) developed this tool to coordinate collaborative mapping efforts for disaster-affected areas. A TeachOSM arm of the tasking manager has been developed to allow for similar collaborative efforts in a classroom setting. Class instructors will need administrator rights on the TeachOSM TaskingManager website to set up a “task” or assignment. Setting up a task will involve outlining the study area, segmenting the area to be mapped, and assigning these segments to students. Visit the TeachOSM TaskingManager site to request adminitrative rights. 

We will go through this tool and it’s interface in the following section (including a video guide). 

##Working with OSM Tasking Manager  
With the area to be mapped chosen, you’ll now have to create a new Job in TeachOSM TM.  This Job will provide the students with geographic location, cell assignments and instructions.  To create new Jobs in TeachOSM TM, you need Administrative rights.

Choose cell or tile size from from the slection bar.  Sizes range from extra large to extra small (XL - XS). Where XL covers more area per tile and XS covers less area per tile.  Avoid creating very large tiles. Smaller more manageable tiles will be potentially less daunting to students and break the area of interest into a manageable size.

For clarification to all users, populate the job with more information such as instructions and a job description.  This space should include a note stating the Job was created as part of a class project and ask those not involved with the class to not use the Job.

##Keeping the work equitable
There are two key things to keep in mind while assigning the work: 1) equitable division of labour and 2) sufficient time for completion.  


Using the "assigned cells" method exclusively will require additional work on behalf of the instructor as they must determine the difficulty level assocated with each cell before assigning them to students. 
Instructors can set a high/medium/low designation on the density/difficulty level for each cell as some cells will have more traceable infrastructure than others.  
To do this, the grid of cells created in OSM TM will have to be exported to a desktop GIS application where the grid can be overlaid on imagery to make the difficulty determination.  This function is not available in OSM TM.

If using the quota option, students will log into OSM TM using their own OSM account credentials to choose a cell in which to start their tracing.
