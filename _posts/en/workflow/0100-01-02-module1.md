#STEP 1: Choosing where to map
##How to choose a site

First off, you need to identify is your study area, or area of interest. This may be your local neigborhood, campus, city, or, a study site abroad that you are actively interested in. If you are working with a partner, then this may have already been identified for you.  

Once your geographic area has been chosen, you need to investigate further.  This involves examining the general study area in OpenStreetMap to see how much work has already been completed. Perhaps the area has already been mapped extensively, and little updating remains. Toggling over and back between the regular map view and the "edit" view will give the best appreciation for the amount complete vs. amount left to do.

Using satellite imagery sources such as ‘bing’ helps estimate the level of difficulty associated with the tracing of map features.  Looking at building density and the clarity/quality of the imagery available for the area will inform this.  Images of poor resolution or with extensive cloud or haze will greatly reduce the number of features that can be clearly identified and traced.   Without a clear idea of the level of work needed to complete the area of interest, it will be difficult to allocate equitable work to students.



##Working with a community partner

Open source mapping modules and assignments are a unique way to integrate service-learning strategies in your course curriculum, while exposing students to new and exciting technological platforms. 
Working with collaborative partners lends gravitas to the work the students perform. The experience teaches civic responsibility and the value of collaborative efforts in the global community.
