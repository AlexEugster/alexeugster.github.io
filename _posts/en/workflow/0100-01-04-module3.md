#STEP 3: Conducting Training
##Develop training schedule
The final step is to get the students introduced and comfortable with the assignment and applications they will be using.  Two days is often sufficient to accomplish this.  

Day 1: an introductory lecture on the assignment, tracing guide, OSM and TM with hands-on experience working with the applications.  If you are working with a partner, have them come in and give a short presentation on the project and the role the students have in the completion of the project.  This will give greater context to the students and adds gravitas to the assignment.  

Day 2: primarily hands-on tracing features, gaining experience with the editor and answering questions.  After this class the students should be comfortable enough to work individually.

Mapping Party: Finally, host a ‘mapping party’, if possible.  This event is meant to be fun, social and a chance for those involved to come together and work through their assignment.  As an incentive for participation, offer food and drinks if your facility/organization can support it. You can even set up a music play list.

This is a sample presentation that can be modified to incorporate the location and parameters of your particular assessment. It hits all the key points in account creation, tracing, tagging, and tracking work in the TaskingManager.

Student Training Video
This is a sample training video, highlighting a class project for Harare, Zimbabwe. Please feel free to use this video as a teaching aide <***include note that it's using OSM TM and NOT TeachOSM TM or you think most will get it and not get confused?***>

##Student Tracing Guide
This is a guide developed by USAID in 2013, to support students participating in the Kathmandu OSM Project at The George Washington University in 2013. Though the examples and screenshots are specific to infrastructure in that city, the lessons on technique, when presented with building infrastructure of varying density, are applicable in many cases.

##Student Workflow Cheat sheet
This 'cheat sheet' is a one page synopsis of the steps necessary to complete the assignment.  Optional but many students have found it useful until they are confident with the workflow.
