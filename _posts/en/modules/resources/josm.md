## The JOSM editor for OpenStreetMap

There is another editor for OpenStreetMap in addition to the [iD editor](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID) which we introduced at the beginning of this guide. The Java OpenStreetMap editor, or [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) is a nice compliment to iD, especially for more complex tasks. While JOSM has a good deal more features, it has a steeper learning curve. But for some advanced tasks, such as managing relations (a special type of geographic data), it is indispensable.
