## The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)

This is a placeholder for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team, colloquially referred to as [HOT](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HOT). 

This is a placeholder, but this section should talk about these things:
Acts as connector between mappers and the humanitarian community.
Remote data collection and mapping on site
Coordinate data collection and data quality
Develops tools for mapping
