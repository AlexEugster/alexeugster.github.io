#Step 2: Assigning work to participants
##Assigning the work
Assigning the work to a class can be done a few different ways and it is entirely a personal choice.  Work can be assigned as a quota of infrastructure to trace, by assigning specific cells to each student or a combination of both of these methods.  The creation of cells is done through OSM Tasking Manager (OSM TM) and explained below. 
Two key things to keep in mind while assigning the work: 1) equitable division of labour and 2) sufficient time for completion.  Using ONLY the assigned cells method would require high/medium/low designation on the density/difficulty for each cell as some cells will have more infrastructure than others.  To do this, the grid of cells created in OSM TM will have to be exported and brought into another application where the imagery can be seen with the grid overlaid on it.  This ability is not available in OSM TM.
If using a quota, students will log into OSM TM using their own OSM account credentials to choose a cell in which to start their tracing.

##TeachOSM TaskingManager
In addition to the OpenStreetMap website, we make use of a tasking tool called TaskingManager. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) developed this tool to coordinate collaborative mapping efforts for disaster-affected areas. A TeachOSM arm of the tasking manager has been developed to allow for similar collaborative efforts in a classroom setting. Class instructors can request an administrator role on the TeachOSM TaskingManager that will allow them to set up a “task” or assignment; this will involve outlining the study area, segmenting the area to be mapping, and assigning these segments to students. 

We will go through this tool and it’s interface in the following section (including a video guide). 

##Working with OSM Tasking Manager  
With the area to be mapped chosen, you’ll now have to create a new Job in TeachOSM TM.  This Job will provide the students with geographic location, cell assignments and instructions.  To create new Jobs in TeachOSM TM, you need Administrative rights.

Choose cell size from drop down.  The larger <***?***> the number the smaller the area covered.  Avoid creating very large cells. Smaller more manageable cells will be potentially less daunting to students and break the area of interest into a manageable size.

For clarification to all users, populate the job with more information such as instructions and a job description.  This space should include a note stating the Job was created as part of a class project and ask those not involved with the class to not use the Job.
