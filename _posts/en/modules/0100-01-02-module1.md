#Step 1: Choosing where to map
##How to choose a site

Pick your city/region, if you are working with a partner, then this may have been done for you.  Once the geographic area is chosen or one has been proposed, you need to investigate it.  This involves looking at it in OSM to see how much work has already been completed but also using satellite imagery such as ‘bing’ so you can estimate the level of difficulty associated with the tracing of features.  Building density and image clarity/quality will inform you of this.  Images of poor resolution or with extensive cloud/haze will greatly reduce the identification of features that can be clearly identified and traced.   Without a clear idea of the level of work needed to complete the area of interest, it will be difficult to assign to students.



##Working with a community partner

Open source mapping modules and assignments are a unique way to integrate service-learning strategies in your course curriculum, while exposing students to new and exciting technological platforms. Working with collaborative partners lends gravitas to the work the students perform. The experience teaches civic responsibility and the value of collaborative efforts in the global community.
