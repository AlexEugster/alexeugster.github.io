# Step 5: Grading & Quality Control
##Grading

Grading contributions to OSM can be a challenge.  Grades need to be fair to the student and you want to ensure the quality of work to the OSM community is of a high standard.  One way to tackle these concerns is to apply the rubric outline here:

* Completeness: The grade is weighted on the completeness of the task.  If only half the assigned work is completed it will be weighted at 50%.
* Quality: the quality of the tracing. For instance, are corners of buildings square and match the footprint accurately or are roads connected properly.
* Coverage: did the student exhaust all of the possible features in the area/cell they chose?  We want to avoid gaps of infrastructure in OSM.

By enforcing a rubric like this, you can ensure a higher quality of work from your students and to the OSM community.

To help manage and monitor the contributions to OSM, the website Overpass-Turbo (http://overpass-turbo.eu/) can be used.  This website can identify the contributions to OSM by a specific student by searching for that students OSM display name.  To do so, follow the steps below:

* go to http://overpass-turbo.eu/
* zoom to the area you wish to check
* use the Wizard  to search for the OSM display name (user:osmname)
* the number of points, lines and polygons created by the user will be noted in the bottom right corner and the features will be highlighted on the screen.

##Quality Control

If you are not working in a traditional classroom setting where the idea of grading is inappropriate, you must still take the quality of the traced map material into consideration.   Consider spot checking the groups work and/or a peer review of the work completed by the group with students fixing mistakes they find.
